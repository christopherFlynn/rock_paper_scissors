# rock_paper_scissors

Not much to talk about in this project, was mostly just a refresher on how to code in JS. Was nice to finally have a good environment to code in though.

This program allows the user to input rock, paper, or scissors and then they get a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying with the computer. Only shows result in console.
